# KAPU Node Documentation

This is a documentation for [kapu-node](https://github.com/kapucoin/kapu-node) built with Swagger UI to make testing a breeze.

## Introduction

Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs.

This allows you to easily build an UI that provides a clean and simple interface for both seasoned developers and people that just get started or want to play around with their Delegate API. Forget the days of setting up your local environment to just test an API Call or sending tedious cURL requests in your terminal... fill out a form, hit execute and see the result!


*Happy coding!*
